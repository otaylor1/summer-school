This is a console-based system that will take in and process student enrollment.
The program shows a menu of choices for enrollment, unenrollment, print list, and exit.
User can smoothly add and take away students as needed and print a list of the current students with the enrollment cost listed as well.
Once maximum enrollment is reached, no new students can be added unless a different student unenrolls.
